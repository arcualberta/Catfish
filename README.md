# Catfish
Catfish is an open-source data repository solution developed based on the Portlan Commons Data Model (PCDM). Currently, it is implemented on top of the Pirahna CMS (.NET 4.6 version), thus Catfish can be used as a hybrid solution with CMS and data repository functionality. Catfish is developed by the Arts Resource Centre, University of Alberta.

## Getting Started
Catfish development setup requres .NET Framework 4.6, Entity Framework 4.6, SQL Server (full or express version 2008 or later), and Apache Solr 7.5 or later.
